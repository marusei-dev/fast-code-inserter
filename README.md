# Fast Code Inserter
## About
### Fast Code Inserter relieves **Warcraft III: Frozen Throne**, **Starcraft: Brood War**, and **Starcraft 2** players of the necessity to enter the embedded cheat codes. The player can predefine which buttons on NumPad correspond to which cheat code and subsequently insert codes by pressing appropriate buttons. It is written entirely in **Python** but a couple of years ago, so I lost the original code. The programme's UI is written in Russian.
